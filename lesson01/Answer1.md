# Decentralized Monopoly Game
to ensure the monopoly game is decentralized and not prone to attack or cheating:
* set a rule that every player plays in the order of their first dice rolls and it applied for the rest of the game.
* every player check if the player honest about their move in their current round and vote  if it valid or invalid with majority as a truth.
* every player have ID that can be verified or whitelisted for eligibity as a monopoly game player.
* implement every rule as a contract on decentralized system like blockchain so it will be trustless, node can verify the valid move instead of players.
